# Text Rewriter Tool

## Overview
This tool is designed to process text files, breaking them into manageable chunks and rewriting them using OpenAI's GPT-4 model. It aims to condense the text, anonymize names, alter institutions and locations, modify references to notable figures, while preserving the core information and maintaining the original tone.

## Features
- Chunking large text files into smaller parts
- Rewriting text to condense and anonymize content
- Preserving the key information and original tone of the text
- Estimating processing time for rewriting tasks

## Usage
To use this tool, you need to have Python installed on your system. You can run the program from the command line by providing an input text file:

```
python main.py input_file.txt
```

The program will generate a new file with the rewritten content, appending `-new` to the original filename.
